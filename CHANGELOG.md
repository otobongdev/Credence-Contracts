## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Ownership transfer failure boundaries**: Added deterministic coverage for suspended-candidate expiry and configuration-epoch overflow, asserting rejected proposals preserve ownership state, proposal metadata, epoch, and events (closes #1422).
- **Admin configuration epoch**: Added a monotonic `ConfigEpoch` to the Admin contract that advances exactly once per committed privileged mutation (admin role changes, suspension, ownership transfer, pause configuration, pause state transitions, and pause-proposal approvals). Exposes `get_config_epoch()` so clients can detect concurrent conflicts and retry; rejected, stale, repeated, and failed operations never advance the epoch and leave no partial state. Documented in `docs/CONFIG_EPOCH.md` and covered by `test_concurrency_race_safety.rs` (closes #1297).
- **Lease scope guard** (`require_matching_lease_scope`): defence-in-depth check that a lease's scope bitmask covers the requested operation. Adds `Lease` / `lease_op` primitives and typed `LeaseScopeMismatch` / `LeaseExpired` errors in `credence_errors` (Closes #847).
- **Expired-lease guard tests**: lock Fresh / Expiring soon / Expired behaviour for `require_no_expired_lease` (Closes #845).
- **Timelock Timeout Test**: Added explicit timeout regression coverage for time-locked operation execution after the grace period (`timelock`).
- **Pause Signer Invariant**: Added invariant test for PauseSignerCount to prevent drift (`credence_delegation`).
- **Slash Bond Core**: Implemented admin-only `slash_bond` functionality with partial/full slashing and event emission.
- **Treasury Guardrails**: Added comprehensive tests and functionality for liquidity floor and slippage protection mechanisms in treasury withdrawals (`credence_treasury`).
- **Batch Bond Atomicity**: Enhanced batch operations with explicit empty batch handling and `MAX_BATCH_BOND_SIZE` enforcement (`credence_bond`).
- **Lease-Signature Helper Tests**: Added Valid / Corrupted / Revoked scenario coverage for the `verify_delegated_signature` lease-signature helper in `contracts/credence_delegation/src/test_lease_signature.rs` (closes #854).
- **Registry idempotency tests**: Added comprehensive test coverage for repeated registration attempts in `credence_registry`, verifying no duplicate records or unexpected state mutations on duplicate `register` calls (closes #1049).
- **Delegation nonce future-window guard**: Added `MAX_NONCE_FUTURE_WINDOW` defence-in-depth check to `consume_nonce` that rejects nonces more than 1 000 ahead of the current value, preventing a compromised client from jumping the nonce stream by large amounts (closes #1062).
- **CI linting guide**: Documented all maintainer-expected linter commands in `docs/CI.md` for contract contributors before PR review (closes #1064).
- **Gas benchmark notes**: Documented hot-path contract call gas profiles, benchmark methodology, and optimization patterns in `docs/gas-benchmark-notes.md` (closes #1057).

### Fixed

- **Arbitration `Archived` status had no verdict**: `require_dispute_resolved` matched only `Open | Voting | Resolving` and `Resolved | Cancelled | Tied`, so after `Archived` was added the crate did not compile (`error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: &DisputeStatus::Archived not covered`). `Archived` now returns `Err(DisputeActive)`, matching the semantics `contracts/arbitration/src/status.rs` already asserted in `archived_state_is_not_terminal_for_resolution`: an archived dispute is *inactive* for lease work but is not a ruling, because `reopen_dispute` can put it back into voting. `test_dispute_guard.rs` was never declared in `lib.rs`, so its assertions never ran; it is now registered and extended with 17 relational and ledger-level regression cases (guard/predicate complementarity, the deliberate `Archived` divergence, pinned discriminants and error code, storage round-trips, out-of-range status codes, and a transition path that may clear the guard exactly once). (Closes #1454.)

- **Arbitration dispute guard**: Added a typed `ArbitrationError::OngoingDispute` guard to reject new disputes while a creator already has an unresolved dispute in progress, closing a defense-in-depth re-entry gap in the arbitration lifecycle. (Closes #850.)

- **No-dynamic-strings in production contract code** (closes #713). New workspace `clippy.toml` declares `disallowed-macros` for `format`, `format_args`, `write`, `writeln` (and their `std::` / `alloc::` / `core::` qualified forms); every contract crate now denies `clippy::disallowed_macros` under `cfg_attr(not(any(test, feature = "testutils")), ...)` so the lint fires for `cargo build --release` and the WASM build but stays silent during `cargo test` and `cargo build --features testutils`. Production contract code now requires `soroban_sdk::Symbol::new(&e, "fixed")` for on-chain event topics and revert surfaces; see `docs/no-dynamic-strings.md` for the threat model and migration table. (Closes #713.)

- Tighten storage TTL bumps across all contracts to prevent silent archival of hot-path data (closes #570). Adds `bump_instance_ttl` to every public entrypoint in `credence_registry`, `admin`, `credence_treasury`, `arbitration`, `credence_multisig`, `timelock`, and `credence_delegation`; adds `extend_ttl` after every persistent write (and on reads) in `credence_bond` slash history, emergency audit trail, and claims modules.

- **`credence_errors` discriminant & match coverage**: Resolved a build-breaking duplicate discriminant between `NoPendingAdmin = 118` and the recently-added `TimestampInFuture = 118`. `TimestampInFuture` was moved into the Delegation error block (new code `513`) and the `ErrorCategory::category()` and `ErrorExt::is_recoverable()` match arms were updated accordingly. The wire-stability assertion in `tests/error_codes_wire.rs` was bumped from `118` to `513`. These changes are safe because no contract could have been deployed with the broken `118` value (the workspace did not compile prior to this fix).

- **Missing `require_contract_uninitialized` helper**: Added `pub fn require_contract_uninitialized(e: &Env, already_initialized: bool)` to `credence_errors` so the 8 call sites in `timelock`, `credence_delegation`, `credence_bond`, `admin`, `credence_registry`, `credence_treasury`, `credence_multisig`, and `templates` that reference it via `credence_errors::require_contract_uninitialized` resolve. The helper is the reference implementation tested by `credence_errors::test_errors`.

- **`verify_no_future_ledger` invocation in `domain.rs:249`**: Replaced the function-style call (which the macro form requires `Result`-returning contexts to satisfy) with an inline `panic_with_error!` so `check_payload_age` continues to use its existing panic-based guard.

- **`DelegatedActionPayload` missing `signature_domain` field**: Added the required `signature_domain: String::from_str(&e, "CredenceDelegation")` to the initializers in `contracts/credence_delegation/src/test_payload_staleness.rs` and `contracts/credence_delegation/tests/nonce_replay.rs` so they match the post-#906 struct layout.

- **`credence_bond` duplicate declarations**: Removed duplicate `mod storage;`, `mod idempotency;` declarations and 8 duplicate `DataKey` variants (`Paused`, `PauseSigner`, `PauseSignerCount`, `PauseThreshold`, `PauseProposalCounter`, `PauseApproval`, `PauseApprovalCount`, `PauseProposal`). The new `IdempotencyKey(Bytes)` and `BorrowFrozen` variants are kept.

### Changed

- **SafeERC20 Migration**: Replaced direct `TokenClient` calls with safe wrapper functions to support non-compliant ERC20 tokens across the protocol.
- **Protocol Fixes**: Resolved compilation errors, completed `top_up` and `extend_duration` with overflow protection.
- **Event Indexing**: Migrated lifecycle events to V2 for optimized off-chain indexing.
