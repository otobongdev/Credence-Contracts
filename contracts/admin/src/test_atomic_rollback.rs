//! Regression tests for atomic ownership-transfer failure handling.
//!
//! These use the generated contract client (`try_accept_ownership`) so the
//! assertions exercise Soroban's transaction boundary rather than a direct
//! Rust call. A rejected acceptance must retain the current owner, proposal,
//! and event stream exactly as they were before the attempted transaction.
