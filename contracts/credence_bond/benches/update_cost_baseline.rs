// This is an off-chain measurement binary, not deployed WASM. Issue #713
// disallows `format!`/etc. in production contract code; benches never run on
// chain, so we silence the lint locally.
#![allot(clippy::disallowed_macros)]

/// Refresh the committed gas baseline for the `credence_bond` contract.
///
/// # When to run
/// Run this **only when a cost change is intended and reviewed** — e.g. you
/// deliberately added a storage write or a new code path and the new numbers are
/// the new normal. A baseline refresh is a reviewable diff: the JSON change lands
/// in the same PR as the code change so reviewers see the cost delta.
///
/// # How to refresh
/// ```sh
/// cargo run -p credence_bond --bin update-cost-baseline
/// ```
/// This overwrites `contracts/credence_bond/cost_baseline.json` with freshly
/// measured numbers. Commit the result. To write somewhere else (the CI gate
/// uses this to produce the "current" snapshot without touching the baseline):
/// ```sh
/// cargo run -p credence_bond --bin update-cost-baseline -- --out /tmp/cost_current.json
/// ```
///
/// # Do NOT
/// Do not refresh the baseline to silence a CI failure you did not expect — an
/// unexpected jump is the signal the gate exists to catch. See
/// `docs/gas-regression.md` for triage steps.
