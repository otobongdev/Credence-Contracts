//! Same-ledger collateral-increase vs sensitive-operation sequencing guard.
//!
//! ## Rationale (issue #996, anti-sandwich)
//!
//! Within one ledger entry (Soroban block) transaction ordering is decided by
//! the host. A caller that observes pending transactions can craft sequences
//! where a slash ("liquidation") runs in the same block as a collateral
//! increase ("borrow" / top-up). When that happens the holder appears to lose
//! stake against a deposit that did not yet exist at the moment the slash
//! decision was made, enabling sandwich-like unfair outcomes and turning the
//! bond invariants into a moving target.
//!
//! The guard:
//!
//! 1. Persists the ledger sequence whenever collateral is added
//!    ([`record_collateral_increase`]).
//! 2. Rejects slash entry points whose current ledger sequence still matches
//!    the recorded one ([`require_slash_allowed_after_collateral_increase`]).
//! 3. Rejects cooldown-withdrawal execution whose current ledger sequence
//!    still matches the recorded one ([`require_cooldown_allowed_after_collateral_increase`]).
//!    This prevents an attacker from collateralizing and then immediately
//!    draining the cooldown window in the same ledger.
//!
//! The check is intentionally one-ledger-only — there is no global throttle
//! and unrelated flows (attestations, withdrawals, parameter changes) are
//! unaffected. Slashes that span two ledger entries are processed normally.
//!
//! ## Backwards compatibility
//!
//! If the storage key has never been written (pre-upgrade contract, freshly
//! deployed contract whose first transaction is a slash without any prior
//! collateral increase) the guard is a no-op so that existing bonds are not
//! bricked.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! The guard sits in front of the canonical slash entry point and is **not**
//! a cross-cutting rate limiter:
//!
//! - Slash (admin) ✅ blocked when same-ledger as a collateral increase
//! - Unslash, slash history, treasury withdrawals ✅ unaffected
//! - Attestations, parameter changes ✅ unaffected
//! - Withdraw (bonded → liquid) ✅ unaffected, even in the same ledger
//! - Cooldown withdrawal execution ✅ blocked when same-ledger as a collateral increase
//!
//! See `../../docs/same-ledger-sequencing.md` for the policy note and the
//! threat model justification.
