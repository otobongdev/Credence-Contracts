/// Signature domain identifier for the CredenceMultisig contract.

/// This constant binds signatures to this specific contract, preventing
/// cross-contract replay attacks where a signature intended for one contract
/// could be replayed against another. Each contract in the Credence system
/// has a unique signature domain constant.
///
/// # Security
///
/// Without domain separation, a signature created for contract A could be
/// replayed against contract B if both contracts share the same nonce namespace
/// and signature verification logic. By including this domain in the signed
/// payload hash, we ensure signatures are only valid for their intended contract.
///
/// # Value
///
/// The domain is a human-readable string that uniquely identifies this contract
/// within the Credence system. It should be included in the signed payload hash
/// along with other payload fields (nonce, deadline, etc.).
