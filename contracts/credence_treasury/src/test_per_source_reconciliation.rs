//! Property-based reconciliation tests asserting that treasury per-source balances
//! always sum to TotalBalance after arbitrary interleavings of receive_fee and
//! execute_withdrawal operations.
//!
//! # Invariant
//! At all times: `BalanceBySource(ProtocolFee) + BalanceBySource(SlashedFunds) == TotalBalance`
//!
//! # Why this matters
//! `execute_withdrawal` computes the `ProtocolFee` deduction via proportional_deduction
//! and derives `SlashedFunds` deduction as `actual_amount - protocol_deduction`. Any
//! rounding or ordering bug can silently desynchronize per-source balances from the total.
//! A property test over random op sequences is the only reliable way to catch such drift.
//!
//! # Operation generation strategy
//! - `receive_fee(ProtocolFee, amount)` — deposit to protocol fee source
//! - `receive_fee(SlashedFunds, amount)` — deposit to slashed funds source
//! - `execute_withdrawal(fraction_of_total)` — withdraw a fraction of the current total
