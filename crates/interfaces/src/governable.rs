/// Governable defines the minimal administrative control interface
/// for a contract.
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// - There is always exactly one admin address at any time.
/// - `set_admin` must be authorized by the current admin.
/// - A successful `set_admin` fully replaces the previous admin; the
///   previous admin loses all administrative privileges immediately.
/// - The admin address must never be the zero/default address.
///
/// # Failure modes
///
/// - Authorization failure: a caller that is not the current admin must
///   cause `set_admin` to revert with an authorization error.
/// - Invalid input: attempting to transfer to the zero address must revert
///   without mutating state.
/// - Self-transfer: transferring to the current admin is a no-op and must
///   not corrupt state.
///
/// # Observability
///
/// Implementations should emit an event on admin transfer so that operators
/// can diagnose failures without exposing sensitive data. The event must not
/// contain anything other than the new admin address.
#[contractclient(name = "GovernableClient")]

    ///
    /// # Authorization
    ///
    /// Requires authorization from the current admin. Callers that are not
    /// the current admin must be rejected.
    ///
    /// # Validation
    ///
    /// `new_admin` must not be the zero address. Transferring to the
    /// current admin is a no-op and must not corrupt state.
    ///
    /// # State transition
    ///
    /// On success, the previous admin is replaced atomically; there is no
    /// intermediate state in which neither address holds administrative
    /// control. If the call reverts, administrative control remains with
    /// the original admin.

/// The trait methods are associated functions (they take `Env`, not `self`),
/// so the documented semantics are pinned here with a small in-memory
/// reference model. Production contracts implement the trait on top of their
/// own on-chain storage; the reference model exists only to check that those
/// implementations uphold the contract below:
///
/// - successful admin transfer,
/// - rejection of unauthorized callers,
/// - rejection of an invalid (zero/default) admin address,
/// - boundary behavior for self-transfer,
/// - recovery after a failed transfer (state must be unchanged),
/// - determinism across repeated calls.
