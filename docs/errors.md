# Error Handling — Credence Contracts

## Overview

All Credence smart contracts share a single error type: `ContractError`, defined in the
`credence_errors` crate (`contracts/credence_errors`). Every public entry-point returns
`Result<T, ContractError>` so callers always receive a typed, categorised, wire-stable
error code instead of an opaque transaction failure.

## Error Code Layout

| Range   | Category       | Primary Contracts                                 |
|---------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1–99    | Initialization | all (bond, registry, delegation, treasury, etc.)  |
| 100–199 | Authorization  | all (bond, registry, delegation, treasury, etc.)  |
| 200–299 | Bond           | credence\_bond                                    |
| 300–399 | Attestation    | credence\_bond, credence\_delegation              |

| 600–699 | Treasury       | credence\_treasury                                |
| 700–799 | Arithmetic     | bond, treasury, and others                        |

> **Stability Guarantee** — Error codes are wire-stable and must **never** be renumbered
> after deployment. Append new variants at the end of their category block only.
>
> See [`docs/error-codes-wire.md`](error-codes-wire.md) for the official bump procedure

## Recoverability

The `ErrorExt::is_recoverable()` method classifies each error as:

- **Recoverable (`true`)** — the caller can fix their input or wait for state to change and
  retry. Examples: `NotAdmin` (switch signer), `LockupNotExpired` (wait), `InvalidNonce`
  (bump nonce).
- **Fatal (`false`)** — the same input will always fail. The fix is not in the caller's
  hands: code-level impossibility, security halt, cryptographic failure, or capacity limit.
  Examples: `Overflow`, `ReentrancyDetected`, `VerificationFailed`, `DomainMismatch`.

Off-chain clients, indexers and the admin CLI should use this signal to decide between
"retry/ignore" vs "alert/halt".

## Workspace Integration

### Adding `credence_errors` to `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
credence_errors = { path = "../../contracts/credence_errors" }
soroban-sdk = { version = "22.0" }

[dev-dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { version = "22.0", features = ["testutils"] }
```

### Importing in contract source

```rust
use credence_errors::{ContractError, ErrorExt};
use soroban_sdk::panic_with_error;

// Fallible entry-points:
pub fn some_fn(e: &Env, ...) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
    if bad_state {
        return Err(ContractError::BondNotFound);
    }
    Ok(())
}

// Panicking guards (e.g., constructor):
pub fn initialize(e: &Env, ...) {
    credence_errors::require_contract_uninitialized(e, storage::get_admin(e).is_some());
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use `?` operator** for fallible entry-points returning `Result<T, ContractError>`.
2. **Use `panic_with_error!`** for initialization and configuration guards.
3. **Never panic with ad-hoc strings** — always map to a canonical error code.
4. **Test both happy path and failure** — at least one test per error code path.
5. **Preserve error codes** — never renumber or remove variants after deployment.
6. **Consult `is_recoverable()`** in off-chain monitoring to distinguish alert vs retry.

---

## FAQ

**Q: How do tests assert a specific error code?**  
Use `assert_eq!` on the `Result::Err` arm, or `#[should_panic(expected = "Error(Contract, #NNN)")]`:

```rust
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "Error(Contract, #200)")]
fn bond_not_found_panics() {
    let env = Env::default();
    // ... call contract method that triggers BondNotFound
}
```

**Q: Can I add new codes?**  
Yes — append only, within the correct category range. Run `cargo test -p credence_errors` afterwards to confirm `ALL_VARIANTS_COUNT` and the exhaustive match arms are updated.

**Q: What if I need a new category?**  
Allocate a new range (e.g. 800–899) and document it here, in `error-codes-wire.md`, and in `contracts/credence_errors/tests/discriminant_uniqueness.rs::RANGES`.
